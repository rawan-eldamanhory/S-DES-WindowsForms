# Simplified DES (S-DES) – Windows Forms Demo

This project is an educational Windows Forms application that demonstrates the
**Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES)** algorithm.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**
S-DES is a teaching algorithm and is **not secure**.
This project is for academic and learning purposes only.
